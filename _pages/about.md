Hello and welcome to my homepage! I am a second-year undergraduate student in School of Environment at Beijing Normal University. My track is now on environmental science. I am interested in the interdiscipline of climate policy and economics, as well as environmental chemistry. Starting in 2023 summer, I've been doing research on CO2 emission in development of digital economics, supervised by Prof. Xin Tian at BNU. I am also pleasured to be advised by Prof. Ke Sun at BNU to do research related to soil contamination.
