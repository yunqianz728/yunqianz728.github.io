About me
======
Hello, and welcome to my homepage! I am a second-year undergraduate student at the School of Environment, Beijing Normal University, majoring in Environmental Science. My academic interests lie at the intersection of climate policy, economics, and environmental chemistry. Since the summer of 2023, I have been conducting research on CO2 emissions in the development of the digital economy, under the supervision of Prof. Xin Tian at Beijing Normal University. Additionally, I am honored to receive guidance from Prof. Ke Sun at BNU for my research on soil contamination.
